# nna

nna (recursive backronym for *nna's not apt*, formerly AllYourFault) is a scoop gui and a windows toolbox.

To *KISS, nna is lightweight, basic, and non-flashy. It's meant to drive down having to waste system resources, and only fits nicely within a few megabytes of both memory and storage.

## FAQ

> Why do this? Scoop is already good enough on its own! And what about Winaero Tweaker?

I'm not really doing this to rival any windows decrapfiers or scoop itself. I just wanted to create a nice and basic place to get programs and decrapify Windows 11, as I was getting sick of it at the time.

> Is there a better way of doing this?

Absolutely. I only did this project as a pet peeve. I don't really want it to be too serious.

> What's with the backronym?

Don't talk about that.

> How do I install it?

See below.

### Installation

Currently there are no binaries for nna. You can build it yourself.

Solution file is set to Visual Studio 2019. You *may* be able to reconstruct the solution to VS 2022 but idk
Make sure NuGet packages work and make sure you have .NET framework 4.7.2 SDK installed.

### Features

Since nna is both a scoop gui and a tweaker, the features are self explanatory.

- A glorified scoop gui
- ...with bucket customization support!
- Tweakers to make Windows "better" *I guess*
- One-click to install it all! No need for other shit (apart from .NET Framework Runtime)
- Lightweight (if you dont count the runtime)
- Specifically made for 10+ (Yes that includes 11, nerds)
