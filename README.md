# ALL YOUR FUCKING FAULT
A scoop gui and a Windows toolbox.

## Hell is this?

This is a glorified Windows toolbox dedicated to making Windows less shit.
It eventually evolved into a gui for scoop. A bad one in particular.
If you see any issues, please attack them to my face.

### Installation

Currently there are no binaries for AllYourFault. You can build it yourself.

Solution file is set to Visual Studio 2019. You *may* be able to reconstruct the solution to VS 2022 but idk
Make sure NuGet packages work and make sure you have .NET framework 4.7.2 SDK installed.

### Features

Features? Well we got em.... features.

- A glorified scoop gui
- ...with bucket customization support!
- Windows scripts
- Lightweight (if you dont count net framework)
- Specifically made for 10+ (Yes that includes 11, nerds)
